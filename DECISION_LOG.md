# Yale Executive Orders Project: Decision Log

This document records key architectural and design decisions made during the development of the Yale Executive Orders project, along with their rationales and alternatives considered.

## 1. Core Architecture Decisions

### 1.1 Preprocessing-to-Static Deployment Model

**Decision**: Use a preprocessing approach with static file deployment rather than a dynamic server.

**Context**: The system needed to provide AI-enhanced analysis with fast performance and high reliability.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Dynamic server with real-time AI processing
- Hybrid approach with some dynamic elements

**Rationale**:
- Static files provide maximum performance and reliability
- AI processing is computationally intensive and better done asynchronously
- GitHub Pages provides free, scalable hosting
- No need for server maintenance or runtime errors
- Better security with no attack surface for server vulnerabilities

**Consequences**:
- Updates require a rebuild and redeploy process
- No dynamic user customization at runtime
- Simpler overall architecture and deployment

### 1.2 SQLite for Local Data Processing

**Decision**: Use SQLite as the local preprocessing database.

**Context**: The system needed a reliable way to store and process data locally before generating static exports.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- PostgreSQL or MySQL database
- NoSQL database (MongoDB)
- Simple JSON file storage

**Rationale**:
- Zero-configuration setup with no separate server
- Full relational database capabilities
- ACID compliance for reliable transactions
- File-based storage for easy backup and version control
- Built-in Node.js support via sqlite3 package

**Consequences**:
- Limited concurrent access (not an issue for preprocessing)
- Need to manage SQLite file backups
- Simpler development workflow

### 1.3 Modular Source Integration

**Decision**: Create a modular source integration system with a consistent API.

**Context**: The system needed to integrate data from multiple sources with different formats and priorities.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Direct API calls in fetch scripts
- Source-specific processing pipelines
- Third-party integration platforms

**Rationale**:
- Consistent interface for all sources

- More flexible and extensible system

## 2. Data Model Decisions

### 2.1 Centralized Schema Definition

**Decision**: Define the entire database schema in a single `schema.js` file.

**Context**: The database schema was becoming complex with multiple tables and relationships.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Schema defined in individual module files
- Schema defined directly in setup scripts
- ORM-based schema definition

**Rationale**:
- Single source of truth for the data model
