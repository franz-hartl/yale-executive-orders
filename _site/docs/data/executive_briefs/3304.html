President Trump's 'Ending Taxpayer Subsidization of Open Borders' executive order directs federal agencies to review immigration policies with the goal of reducing federal funds supporting illegal immigration. While primarily targeting sanctuary cities and certain public benefits, the order may have implications for universities like Yale that provide services to international students and potentially undocumented students.

Yale University will need to evaluate its current policies regarding undocumented students and ensure compliance with any new federal directives arising from this order. This may include reviewing financial aid policies, campus support services, and any programs that might be interpreted as supporting undocumented students. The order may also affect certain federal grants related to international programs.

Financially, Yale may need to adjust program budgets related to international student services, implement additional compliance measures, and possibly reallocate resources from affected areas. The university should prepare for potential scrutiny of its policies and practices regarding undocumented students and international scholars, while balancing compliance with its institutional values.
