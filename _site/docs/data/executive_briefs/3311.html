President Trump's executive order eliminating the Federal Executive Institute (FEI) will have modest implications for Yale University. The primary impact will be on Yale School of Management's executive education programs, which occasionally partner with or serve federal executives who previously might have trained at the FEI.

With the FEI's elimination, Yale may experience a slight increase in federal executives seeking alternative leadership development opportunities through university programs. This could present a potential opportunity to expand offerings targeted at public sector leadership, particularly through the School of Management and potentially the Jackson School of Global Affairs.

Financially, any impact would be minimal and limited to modest potential revenue opportunities in executive education programs. Yale should monitor developments regarding how federal agencies will address executive development needs following the FEI's elimination, which could inform strategic decisions about program offerings and potential partnerships.
