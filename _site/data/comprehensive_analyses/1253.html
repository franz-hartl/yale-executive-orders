            <h2 style="color: #2563eb; font-size: 1.5rem; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Federal Energy Emergency Powers Invoked - Implications for Higher Education</h2>
            <p style="font-size: 1rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>Overview:</strong> Citing threats to energy reliability and affordability, this executive order invokes federal emergency powers to control energy production, distribution and pricing. It aims to protect consumers and the economy from supply disruptions and price shocks. However, the unprecedented market intervention creates significant uncertainty.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 1rem; background-color: #f0f9ff; padding: 0.75rem; border-left: 4px solid #2563eb; font-weight: 500;">
              <strong>Bottom Line:</strong> Universities must carefully monitor energy market dynamics, assess budget risks under various scenarios, and proactively engage campus stakeholders to plan for cost volatility and potential service disruptions.

              <h4 style="font-size: 1rem; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Policy Background:</h4>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">Domestic energy shortages have occurred sporadically in the past (e.g. 1973-74 oil crisis). However, the broad scope of this order is unprecedented in the post-war era. It builds on the Defense Production Act and Section 202(c) of the Federal Power Act.</p>

              <h4 style="font-size: 1rem; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Legal Framework:</h4>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">The order's statutory authority rests on emergency powers in the Federal Power Act, Natural Gas Act, and Energy Policy and Conservation Act. Implementation may require agency rulemakings subject to Administrative Procedure Act. Certain provisions could face legal challenges around scope of authority.</p>

              <h4 style="font-size: 1rem; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Higher Education Context:</h4>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">U.S. higher education faces mounting financial pressures from inflation, declining enrollments, and public funding cuts. Endowment returns have weakened and many institutions are in deficit positions. The sector overall has limited flexibility to absorb energy cost spikes.</p>
