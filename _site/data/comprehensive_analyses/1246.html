            <h2 style="color: #2563eb; font-size: 1.5rem; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Honoring American Greatness: Implications of Renaming Requirements for Higher Education Institutions</h2>
            <p style="font-size: 1rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>Overview:</strong> Executive Order 2025-02096 directs all federal agencies to conduct a thorough review of named entities under their jurisdiction and rename those deemed inconsistent with the nation's highest ideals. While the order does not directly address universities, they will need to take proactive steps to align institutional naming practices with this new mandate. This will require careful consideration of campus naming conventions, stakeholder engagement, legal and financial implications, and alignment with mission and values.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 1rem; background-color: #f0f9ff; padding: 0.75rem; border-left: 4px solid #2563eb; font-weight: 500;">
              <strong>Bottom Line:</strong> Universities should use this order as an opportunity to thoughtfully re-examine naming practices, engage their communities in productive dialogue, and take bold action where renaming serves the institutional mission. However, they must also weigh the considerable costs, complexities and potential controversies involved.

              <h4 style="font-size: 1rem; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Policy Background:</h4>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">The order reflects a broader national reckoning with legacies of racial injustice, colonialism and other forms of historical oppression embedded in many institutional naming conventions. It builds on recent removals of Confederate monuments and changes to racist sports team names.</p>

            <div style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">
              <h4 style="font-size: 1rem; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Legal Framework:</h4>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">While the order only directly binds federal agencies, universities should review applicable federal, state and local laws as well as institutional bylaws and gift agreements that may constrain naming changes. Public universities in particular may face First Amendment challenges.</p>

              <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">The order accelerates an existing trend of universities grappling with controversial building names and monuments, from Yale's Calhoun College to Princeton's Woodrow Wilson School. Institutions have taken varying approaches to balancing historical context, community input and decisiveness of action.</p>

                  <p><strong>Naming Conventions and Policies:</strong> Universities will need to thoroughly audit existing named buildings, spaces, programs, professorships, scholarships and other entities to determine whether they align with the 'American greatness' standard. This may also require revising policies and procedures for future naming proposals and gift agreements.</p>
                </div>
              
                <div style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem; padding: 0.75rem; background-color: #f9fafb; border-radius: 0.375rem;">
                  <p><strong>Stakeholder Engagement and Shared Governance:</strong> Renaming decisions will generate intense interest from students, faculty, alumni, donors, local communities and political leaders. Universities will need robust processes for gathering input, fostering dialogue and building consensus, while respecting principles of shared governance.</p>

            <div style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">
              <h4 style="font-size: 1rem; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Compliance Requirements:</h4>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">While not legally binding, universities should consult the DOJ Civil Rights Division's guidance on reviewing names for discriminatory intent or impact. Institutions should document task force membership, review criteria, stakeholder engagement efforts, and decision justifications. Public universities should carefully navigate public records laws.</p>
            </div>

            <div style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">
              <h4 style="font-size: 1rem; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Competitive Implications:</h4>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">Institutions that move quickly and thoughtfully on renaming may enhance reputations for inclusion and social impact, attracting students/faculty/funders who value those priorities. Less proactive schools risk appearing tone-deaf or indecisive. HBCUs and other minority-serving institutions have unique opportunities to showcase their histories.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">
              <h4 style="font-size: 1rem; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Long-term Vision:</h4>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">Universities should use this moment to fundamentally re-envision how they deploy public honor and memory to advance their missions. Naming can be a powerful tool to build belonging, inspire new generations, spark learning, and generate resources to invest in communities. Institutions should articulate clear philosophies to guide future naming decisions.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">
              <h4 style="font-size: 1rem; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Advocacy Opportunities:</h4>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">Higher education associations should proactively engage federal agencies to help shape implementation guidance, such as defining what constitutes 'American greatness' for naming purposes. Individual institutions can also comment on proposed agency actions through public feedback processes and highlight positive renaming outcomes.</p>

            <p style="font-weight: 500; margin-bottom: 1rem; color: #b91c1c;">
              <strong>Action Required:</strong> Yes. Given the high visibility of this issue and potential for rapid government action, universities should proactively review naming conventions and engage stakeholders now, rather than waiting for controversy to emerge. Even schools without obvious renaming candidates will benefit from assessing alignment of naming practices with mission and engaging their communities around these issues.
