President Trump's executive order applying the Protecting Americans From Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act to TikTok directly affects Yale University's digital communication strategy and presents considerations for academic research and teaching. Yale currently maintains institutional TikTok accounts with approximately 25,000 followers across several schools and departments, primarily used for student recruitment, community engagement, and institutional branding.

Yale's Office of Communications and relevant digital media teams should develop an immediate contingency plan for alternative platforms that can reach similar audiences. Admissions departments, which have increasingly relied on TikTok for student outreach, should particularly focus on developing alternative digital engagement strategies.

Beyond communications impact, this order creates teaching implications for courses addressing social media, digital communications, and international technology policy, particularly in the School of Management, Department of Computer Science, and Jackson School of Global Affairs. Additionally, research projects analyzing TikTok data or comparing social media platforms may require methodological adjustments. While the direct financial impact is minimal, the strategic communications and academic implications require thoughtful planning and adaptation.
