Executive Order 14058 directs federal agencies to improve their customer experience and service delivery, which will have several implications for research universities like Yale. The order mandates increased data sharing and coordination between agencies and external partners, including higher education institutions. This will require updates to compliance procedures and reporting across multiple administrative offices, including the Office of Research Administration, Financial Aid, and Bursar. Universities should expect new requirements for submitting student data, research grant information, and other administrative details. While the order does not directly impact funding levels, the new compliance burden could indirectly increase administrative costs. Institutions should prioritize reviewing current data sharing practices, identifying needed process changes, and engaging with relevant federal agencies to ensure a smooth transition within the next 6-12 months.
