Executive Order 14058 on improving federal customer experience aims to enhance government service delivery, which will require increased data sharing and coordination between federal agencies and higher education institutions. This will most directly impact the administrative and research operations of research universities like Yale, necessitating updates to compliance procedures and increased reporting across offices like the Office of Research Administration, Financial Aid, and Bursar.
