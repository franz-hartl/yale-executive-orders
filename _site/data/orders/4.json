The far-reaching nature of this executive order demands a coordinated, strategic response from higher education institutions. Universities must review the details of the order, analyze implications across different mission areas, and develop a comprehensive plan to align research, education, and operations with federal climate priorities. Effective response will require engagement at all levels, from university leadership to individual faculty, students, and staff.\n            </p>\n            \n            <div style=\"margin-bottom: 1rem;\">\n              <h4 style=\"font-size: 1rem; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;\">Immediate Steps (0-30 days):</h4>\n              <ul style=\"padding-left: 1.5rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;\">\n                <li>Establish cross-functional climate response task force</li><li>Map current research, education and operations to identify alignment</li><li>Analyze federal funding landscape and identify opportunities</li><li>Communicate importance to university community and stakeholders</li>\n              </ul>\n            </div>\n            \n            <div style=\"margin-bottom: 1rem;\">\n              <h4 style=\"font-size: 1rem; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;\">Short-term Actions (1-3 months):</h4>\n              <ul style=\"padding-left: 1.5rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;\">\n                <li>Develop institution-wide climate action plan</li><li>Identify and pursue priority funding opportunities</li><li>Incorporate climate considerations into all new initiatives</li><li>Launch faculty/student ideation on research and curriculum</li>\n              </ul>\n            </div>\n            \n            <div style=\"margin-bottom: 1rem;\">\n              <h4 style=\"font-size: 1rem; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;\">Long-term Considerations:</h4>\n              <ul style=\"padding-left: 1.5rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;\">\n                <li>Ensure climate is central to university strategic planning</li><li>Invest in faculty hiring and program development in key areas</li><li>Collaborate with other institutions and partners on major initiatives</li><li>Continuously monitor and adapt to evolving federal priorities</li>\n              </ul>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          \n          <!-- Resource Requirements Section -->\n          <div class=\"resources\" style=\"margin-bottom: 1rem; background-color: #f9fafb; padding: 1rem; border-radius: 0.375rem;\">\n            <h3 style=\"color: #2563eb; font-size: 1.25rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem;\">Resource Requirements:</h3>\n            <div style=\"display: grid; grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr); gap: 1rem;\">\n              <div>\n                <p><strong>Personnel:</strong> Potential need for new sustainability staff, grant managers, government relations.
