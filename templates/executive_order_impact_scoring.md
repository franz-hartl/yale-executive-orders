# Executive Order Impact Scoring Guide for Higher Education Institutions

This guide provides standardized methods for quantitatively assessing the impact of executive orders on different types of higher education institutions. The scoring approach allows for consistent evaluation while accounting for institutional diversity.

## SCORING METHODOLOGY OVERVIEW

The impact scoring system uses:
- A 1-5 scale for severity (1=minimal, 5=critical)
- Weighted averages across functional areas
- Institution-specific modifiers
- Composite scores to determine overall impact level

## BASELINE IMPACT SCORING

### Scoring Scale (1-5)

| Score | Impact Level | Definition |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| 5 | Critical | Requires institutional transformation; affects core mission; demands significant resources |
| 4 | High | Substantial operational changes required; notable resource allocation needed |
| 3 | Moderate | Meaningful adjustments needed; manageable with moderate resources |
| 2 | Low | Minor procedural changes; minimal resource requirements |
| 1 | Minimal | Negligible effect; no specific action required |

### Functional Area Weighting

Different functional areas have varying importance depending on institution type. The following weighting factors should be applied:

#### Research Universities (R1/R2)
- Research Operations: 0.25
- Academic Programs: 0.15
- International Programs: 0.15
- Regulatory Compliance: 0.15
- Student Aid & Financing: 0.10
- Diversity Initiatives: 0.10
- Workforce & Employment: 0.05
- Public-Private Partnerships: 0.05

#### Master's Universities
- Academic Programs: 0.20
- Student Aid & Financing: 0.20
- Research Operations: 0.15
- Regulatory Compliance: 0.15

- Research Operations: 0.00
- International Programs: 0.00

#### Specialized Institutions
Weighting depends on specialty area. For example, a medical school might weight:
- Research Operations: 0.30
- Academic Programs: 0.25
- Regulatory Compliance: 0.20
- Workforce & Employment: 0.10
- Public-Private Partnerships: 0.10
- International Programs: 0.05
- Diversity Initiatives: 0.00
- Student Aid & Financing: 0.00

## INSTITUTIONAL MODIFIER CALCULATIONS

### Size-Based Modifiers
- **Large** (>15,000 students): +0.2 to Regulatory Compliance score
- **Medium** (5,000-15,000 students): No modifier
- **Small** (<5,000 students): -0.1 to Regulatory Compliance score, +0.2 to Resource Intensity

### Funding-Based Modifiers
- **Well-Endowed Private**: -0.3 to Resource Intensity
- **Tuition-Dependent Private**: +0.2 to Student Aid & Financing score
- **State-Funded Public**: +0.2 to Regulatory Compliance score
- **Primarily Federally Funded**: +0.3 to Research Operations score, +0.3 to Regulatory Compliance score

### Research Activity Modifiers
- **Very High Research**: +0.4 to Research Operations score, +0.2 to International Programs score
- **High Research**: +0.3 to Research Operations score, +0.1 to International Programs score
- **Moderate Research**: +0.2 to Research Operations score
- **Low Research**: No modifier

### International Engagement Modifiers
- **High International**: +0.3 to International Programs score
- **Moderate International**: +0.1 to International Programs score
- **Limited International**: No modifier

## IMPACT SCORE CALCULATION FORMULA

For each functional area:
1. Determine baseline impact score (1-5)
2. Apply institutional modifiers
3. Apply area weighting factor
4. Sum weighted scores to get composite score

**Formula:**
Composite Score = Σ(Baseline Score + Institutional Modifier) × Area Weight

**Interpretation:**
- 4.5 - 5.0: Critical Impact
- 3.5 - 4.4: High Impact
- 2.5 - 3.4: Moderate Impact
- 1.5 - 2.4: Low Impact
- 1.0 - 1.4: Minimal Impact

## URGENCY CALCULATION

Urgency is calculated separately from impact severity, based on implementation timelines:

| Factor | Points |
|--------|--------|
| Specified compliance deadline within 30 days | +3 |
| Specified compliance deadline within 31-90 days | +2 |
| Specified compliance deadline within 91-180 days | +1 |
| No specified deadline or >180 days | +0 |
| Required reporting to federal agencies | +1 |
| Enforcement mechanisms specified | +1 |
| Penalties for non-compliance specified | +1 |

**Urgency Rating:**
- 5-6 points: Immediate (0-30 days)
- 3-4 points: Near-term (1-3 months)
- 1-2 points: Medium-term (3-6 months)
- 0 points: Long-term (6+ months)

---

## RESOURCE INTENSITY CALCULATION

Resource intensity measures the level of institutional resources required for implementation:

| Factor | Points |
|--------|--------|
| Requires new full-time positions | +2 |
| Requires new technologies/systems | +2 |
| Requires significant policy revisions | +1 |
| Requires training programs | +1 |
| Requires cross-institutional coordination | +1 |
| Requires board/governance approval | +1 |
| Requires external reporting | +1 |

**Apply Institution-Specific Modifiers:**
- Apply size-based modifier (as above)
- Apply funding-based modifier (as above)

**Resource Intensity Rating:**
- 7-9 points: High
- 4-6 points: Moderate
- 0-3 points: Low

- **Peer Validation**: Compare with similar institutions to validate approach
- **Expert Review**: Have subject matter experts review initial scores
- **Historical Benchmarking**: Compare to past executive orders with known impacts

### Practical Applications
- **Resource Allocation**: Use scores to determine appropriate resource levels
- **Implementation Planning**: Develop timeline based on urgency rating
- **Risk Management**: Focus on highest-scoring functional areas
- **Leadership Briefing**: Present quantified impact to inform strategic decisions
- **Cross-Institutional Collaboration**: Share scores to identify common challenges
