# Higher Education Executive Order Impact Assessment Framework

This framework provides a structured approach to evaluating how executive orders affect different types of higher education institutions. The multi-dimensional assessment allows institutions to quickly identify the relevance and severity of impacts based on their specific characteristics and context.

## USING THIS FRAMEWORK

1. **Identify Your Institution Profile**: Determine which categories best match your institution (type, size, funding model, etc.)
2. **Review Impact Matrices**: Examine the impact ratings across different functional areas for your institution type
3. **Consider Contextual Factors**: Adjust the baseline assessment using the modifying factors
4. **Document Institution-Specific Impacts**: Use the template to create a customized impact profile

## IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE

### Using the Impact Assessment for Planning
1. **Complete the Customized Template**: Fill in each section based on your institution's profile
2. **Calculate Adjusted Impact Scores**: Apply relevant modifying factors to baseline scores
3. **Prioritize Functional Areas**: Focus on areas with highest adjusted impact scores
4. **Develop Tailored Response**: Create action plans that address your specific impact profile
5. **Allocate Resources Strategically**: Direct resources to highest priority areas
6. **Establish Monitoring Mechanisms**: Track implementation progress against impact levels
7. **Reassess Periodically**: Update impact assessment as implementation progresses

### Common Implementation Challenges by Institution Type

#### R1 Research Universities
- Balancing compliance with research productivity
- Managing international collaboration restrictions
- Coordinating across decentralized units

#### Master's and Baccalaureate Institutions
- Allocating limited compliance resources
- Maintaining academic program flexibility
- Addressing student aid implications

#### Community Colleges
- Aligning workforce programs with new requirements
- Supporting diverse student populations
- Managing compliance with limited specialized staff
