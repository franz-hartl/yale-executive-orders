## Using the Templates

These templates are designed to be flexible and adaptable. Institutions should:

1. Select the appropriate template based on their needs
2. Customize the analysis for their specific context
3. Adjust the institutional impact sections based on their type and mission
4. Complete all sections with institution-specific information

The templates are in Markdown format for easy conversion to various document types (Word, PDF, HTML) and can be integrated into institutional knowledge management systems.

## Implementation Tips

- **Differentiated Analysis:** Pay special attention to the "Institution Type Impact Matrix" to understand how the executive order might affect your specific institution type
- **Cross-Functional Review:** Involve stakeholders from relevant areas (legal, academic affairs, research, etc.) in completing the template
- **Specificity:** Replace all placeholder text with specific information relevant to the executive order being analyzed
- **Regular Updates:** Revisit and update the analysis as new information becomes available (agency guidance, legal challenges, etc.)

These templates represent a standardized approach to executive order analysis across the higher education sector, allowing for both institution-specific assessment and broader sector-wide understanding.
