## Implementation Tips

- **Differentiated Analysis:** Pay special attention to the "Institution Type Impact Matrix" to understand how the executive order might affect your specific institution type
- **Cross-Functional Review:** Involve stakeholders from relevant areas (legal, academic affairs, research, etc.) in completing the template
- **Specificity:** Replace all placeholder text with specific information relevant to the executive order being analyzed
- **Regular Updates:** Revisit and update the analysis as new information becomes available (agency guidance, legal challenges, etc.)

These templates represent a standardized approach to executive order analysis across the higher education sector, allowing for both institution-specific assessment and broader sector-wide understanding.
