# Higher Education Sector-Wide Approach

This document explains how this project has been transformed from a Yale-specific tool into a comprehensive sector-wide resource for higher education institutions.

## 1. Overview

The Executive Orders Analysis project has undergone a strategic shift from serving a single institution (Yale University) to addressing the needs of the entire higher education sector. This transformation recognizes that executive orders impact diverse institutions differently based on their type, size, mission, and resources.

Key aspects of this sector-wide transformation include:
- Reframing analysis to address impacts across multiple institution types
- Implementing differentiated impact assessments based on institution characteristics
- Creating multi-level summary formats for different user needs
- Enhancing the database schema to support institution-specific data
- Modifying HTML templates to display content relevant to each institution type

## 2. Institution Differentiation

The system now provides customized analysis for multiple institution categories:

| Institution Type | Key Characteristics | Analysis Focus |
|-----------------|---------------------|----------------|
| R1 Research Universities | High research activity (>$100M), large federal grant portfolio, medical schools | Research security, federal funding, international collaboration |
| R2 Research Universities | Moderate research ($50-100M), smaller grant portfolio | Grant compliance, faculty research |
| Master's Universities | Limited research, focus on master's programs | Program development, teaching focus |
| Baccalaureate Colleges | Primarily undergraduate, teaching-focused | Student programs, educational access |
| Community Colleges | Associate's degrees, workforce development | Workforce training, access programs |
| Specialized Institutions | Focused missions (medical, arts, technical) | Domain-specific compliance |

The analysis also distinguishes between:
- Public vs. Private institutions (governance and funding differences)
- Large vs. Medium vs. Small institutions (resource and capacity differences)

## 3. Multi-Level Analysis Format

Each executive order is now analyzed at three distinct levels to serve different user needs:

### Executive Brief (TL;DR)
- 1-2 sentences (maximum 50 words)
- Extremely concise summary of the core impact
- Notes significant variations by institution type
- Answers: "What's the one thing I need to know about this order?"

### Standard Summary (400-500 words)
- Structured in three parts:
  1. **Executive Summary**: Title, overview, bottom-line takeaway
  2. **Institution-Specific Impacts**: Impact matrix by institution type, key functional areas affected, important deadlines, affected departments
  3. **Differentiated Action Plan**: Required actions (with exemptions noted), immediate steps, short-term actions, resource requirements by institution type

### Comprehensive Analysis (1000-1200 words)
- Includes all Standard Summary elements plus:
  1. **Detailed Context**: Policy background, legal framework, sector context, exemptions for specific institution types
  2. **Implementation Specifics**: Institution impact matrix (1-5 scale), compliance details by institution type, resource intensity by size
  3. **Strategic Considerations**: Competitive implications, long-term vision, advocacy opportunities, coalition potential

## 4. AI Prompt Engineering

The Claude AI prompts were substantially modified to generate institution-differentiated analysis:

- **System Prompt Enhancement**: Added expertise in institutional differentiation and policy domains relevant to diverse institution types
- **Institution Types Definition**: Included detailed descriptions of institution categories (R1/R2, master's, baccalaureate, community colleges, specialized)
- **Impact Domain Framework**: Defined key domains (research funding, DEI, immigration, labor, compliance) with institution-specific analysis points
- **Resource Scaling Guidance**: Added instructions for how to scale resource requirements based on institution size
- **Cross-Institution Comparisons**: Prompted for explicit comparisons of how impacts vary across institution types
- **Exemptions Analysis**: Added specific instruction to identify carve-outs or special provisions by institution type
- **JSON Structure**: Modified the output structure to include institution-specific fields in each analysis section

The prompt engineering balances the need for detailed, differentiated analysis with token efficiency to avoid context limit errors.

## 5. Technical Adaptations

### Database Schema Extensions
- Added `institution_types` table to define different categories of institutions
- Created `functional_areas` table to track institutional functions affected by orders
- Implemented `differentiated_impacts` table to store impact ratings (1-5) by institution type
- Added `compliance_timelines` to track implementation deadlines by institution
- Created `impact_scoring` table for quantitative comparison across institution types

### HTML Template Modifications
- Added institution type selector to filter content based on user's institution
- Implemented tabbed views for different institution categories
- Created collapsible sections for institution-specific guidance
- Added color-coding to indicate impact severity by institution type
- Implemented resource requirement tables that break down needs by institution size

### Export Modifications
- Enhanced JSON structure to include institution-specific fields
- Created template rendering functions that adapt to selected institution type
- Implemented filter logic to show/hide content based on institution relevance

## 6. Future Development

Next steps for enhancing the sector-wide capabilities include:

1. **Dynamic Institution Profiles**: Allow users to create custom institution profiles combining characteristics from different categories

2. **Institutional Survey Integration**: Collect actual implementation data from institutions to refine impact predictions

3. **Peer Comparison Tools**: Provide benchmarking against similar institutions' compliance approaches

4. **Compliance Timeline Generator**: Create custom timeline views showing deadlines specific to the user's institution type

5. **Resource Calculator**: Develop an interactive tool that estimates personnel, budget, and technology needs based on institution size and type

6. **Policy Network Analysis**: Map relationships between executive orders to show compounding impacts on specific institution types

7. **Consortium-Building Tools**: Identify opportunities for institutions of similar types to collaborate on compliance

8. **State-Level Integration**: Incorporate analysis of how state policies interact with federal executive orders for public institutions

These enhancements will further strengthen the platform's ability to serve the diverse needs of the higher education sector while maintaining its foundation of rigorous, institution-specific analysis.
