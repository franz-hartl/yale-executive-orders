# Yale-Specific Refocusing Implementation Summary

We have successfully implemented Phase 1 of the Yale-Specific refocusing, streamlining the application to focus exclusively on Yale University's organizational structure and needs.

## Key Changes Implemented

### 1. Database Schema Simplification
- Removed generic institution types tables and multi-institution complexity
- Created Yale department structure with reporting relationships
- Added Yale-specific impact mapping tables
- Created Yale compliance timelines and actions tables

### 2. Yale Organizational Structure
- Implemented Yale's actual departmental structure
- Added reporting relationships between departments
- Included contact information for each Yale unit
- Created Yale department IDs for direct referencing

### 3. Yale Impact Area Mapping
- Updated Yale impact areas to link directly to departments
- Assigned primary and secondary departments to each impact area
- Included Yale-unique domains such as:
  - Arts & Cultural Heritage (museums, collections)
  - Yale College Experience (residential colleges)
  - Medical & Clinical Operations (Yale Medicine)
  - Athletics & Student Activities

### 4. Export Process Simplification
- Streamlined JSON export to focus on Yale-relevant data
- Modified system and metadata information to be Yale-specific
- Added Yale guidance section to replace multi-institution guidance
- Updated impact analysis to reference Yale departments directly

### 5. AI Prompt Enhancement
- Refocused AI prompts on Yale's organizational structure
- Included specific Yale departments in prompt context
- Modified JSON output structure to reference Yale departments
- Updated department responsibility structure for better clarity

## Documentation Created

- `YALE_FOCUS.md`: Detailed implementation approach
- `README-YALE-FOCUS.md`: User-facing documentation
- `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`: Summary of changes (this file)

## Next Steps

1. Add Yale department dashboards to the user interface
2. Create department-specific views for different Yale stakeholders
3. Implement Yale mission alignment assessment
4. Develop Yale-specific search and filtering options
5. Add email notification capabilities for Yale departments

## Benefits of Yale-Specific Focus

- **Direct Relevance**: All analysis is specific to Yale's structure
- **Simpler Data Model**: Focused exclusively on Yale's organization
- **Clear Responsibilities**: Directly maps to Yale departments
- **Reduced Complexity**: Simpler code and data structures
- **More Efficient**: Smaller, more targeted data exports

## Migration Approach

Existing data will be migrated to the Yale-specific structure:
1. Executive orders will maintain their base information
2. Impact areas will be mapped to Yale departments
3. Generic institution type information will be removed
4. Yale-specific guidance will replace multi-institution guidance

This implementation provides a solid foundation for the Yale-specific focus, making the application more relevant, efficient, and tailored to Yale University's unique needs.
