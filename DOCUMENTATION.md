# Yale Executive Orders Project Documentation Hub

Welcome to the comprehensive documentation for the Yale Executive Orders Analysis Platform. This hub provides a centralized entry point to navigate all aspects of the system.

## System Overview

The Yale Executive Orders Analysis Platform is a comprehensive system designed to analyze executive orders and their specific impacts on private R1 research universities. This project uses a novel preprocessing-to-static architecture with advanced AI integration to provide institution-specific guidance.

## Key Concepts

### Essential Simplicity

The project follows the "Essential Simplicity" design philosophy:

1. **Complexity Reduction**: Prioritize removing unnecessary complexity over adding features
2. **Flat Architecture**: Minimize nested structures and eliminate unnecessary layers 
3. **Single Responsibility**: Each component does one thing well
4. **Composability**: Components can be chained together for complex operations
5. **Clean Interfaces**: Well-defined contracts between components
6. **Efficiency**: Optimize resource usage (AI tokens, computation, storage)
7. **Maintainability**: Make decisions that prioritize long-term code health

### Knowledge-Centric Design

The system treats executive order analysis as a knowledge representation problem:

- Facts are discrete units with typed classification
- Source attribution is maintained for provenance
- Relationships between facts are explicitly modeled
- Confidence scores represent uncertainty
- Conflicts between sources are explicitly managed

### Preprocessing-to-Static Architecture

The system follows a preprocessing-to-static deployment model:

1. All data processing happens during preprocessing
2. Processed data is exported to static JSON and HTML files
3. Static files are deployed to GitHub Pages
4. No server-side runtime requirements
5. Fast, scalable, and secure static website

## System Capabilities

### Core Features

1. **AI-Enhanced Analysis**: Leverages Claude AI for categorization, plain language summaries, and impact assessment
2. **University-Focused Classification**: Tailored categorization system for higher education impact
3. **Plain Language Summaries**: Accessible explanations of complex executive orders
4. **Comprehensive Data Organization**: Well-structured data with full-text search and filtering
5. **Integrated Data Sources**: Combines multiple authoritative sources with intelligent merging
6. **Institution-Specific Guidance**: Provides tailored recommendations for private R1 institutions
7. **Interactive Interface**: Clean, table-based UI for browsing and accessing details

### Advanced Features

1. **Knowledge Representation**: Store typed facts with source attribution and relationships
2. **Conflict Detection**: Automatically identify and manage contradictory information
3. **Template Generation**: Create consistent documents from executive order data
4. **Intelligence Hub**: Synthesize information from multiple sources
5. **Workflow Automation**: End-to-end process from data collection to deployment
