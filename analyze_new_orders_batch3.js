Potential Enrollment Effects: Possible modest increases in veteran student enrollment following service reinstatements, which would bring associated tuition revenue and financial aid considerations.\n\n3. Research Funding: Limited potential effects on research grants studying vaccination policies or military health outcomes, which may need methodological adjustments.\n\nSTRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS:\nYale should consider several approaches in response to this executive order:\n\n1. Policy Review: Conduct a targeted review of vaccination requirements in programs with significant military or veteran participation to ensure appropriate alignment while maintaining institutional public health standards.\n\n2. Stakeholder Communication: Develop clear communication for military-affiliated students and ROTC participants regarding how Yale will navigate any policy differences between university and military requirements.\n\n3. Research Adaptation: Support researchers in fields affected by changing vaccination patterns in incorporating these policy shifts into their methodological approaches.\n\n4. Balanced Implementation: Maintain appropriate distinction between direct military policy changes (which must be implemented in ROTC and similar programs) and broader university health policies (where Yale retains institutional autonomy).\n\nThe executive order represents a low impact on Yale University operations. While creating tangible considerations for specific programs involving military-affiliated populations, it does not fundamentally affect core university operations or require substantial policy overhauls. The primary university impact areas are Administrative Compliance (particularly for ROTC and veteran programs) with minimal effects on Research Funding and Workforce & Employment Policy.",
