# Yale-Specific Focus Implementation

This document outlines the implementation of Phase 1: Yale-Specific Refocusing, which streamlines the Executive Orders Analysis tool to focus exclusively on Yale University's organizational structure and needs.

## Yale-Specific Focus Overview

The application has been refocused to serve Yale University specifically, with these key changes:

1. **Simplified Database Schema**: Removed generic institution types and replaced with Yale's actual organizational structure
2. **Yale-Specific Impact Areas**: Updated impact areas to map directly to Yale departments and organizational units
3. **Streamlined Export Process**: Simplified JSON export formats to focus only on Yale-relevant data
4. **Organizational Mapping**: Created direct connections between executive orders and Yale departments

## Technical Implementation Details

### Database Schema Simplification

The database schema has been modified to replace generic institution structures with Yale-specific tables:

- Removed: `institution_types`, `differentiated_impacts`, `impact_scoring`
- Added: `yale_departments`, `yale_impact_mapping`, `yale_compliance_timelines`
- Modified: Compliance actions and implementation resources are now Yale-specific

### Yale Organizational Structure

The implementation includes Yale's actual organizational structure:

- **Key Departments**: Office of the President, Office of the Provost, General Counsel, Research Administration, etc.
- **Reporting Relationships**: Hierarchical structure with appropriate parent-child relationships
- **Contact Information**: Direct points of contact for each department

### Yale Impact Area Mapping

Yale impact areas have been directly connected to Yale departments:

- Each impact area has one primary Yale department owner
- Secondary Yale departments are identified as supporting stakeholders
- Impact areas include Yale-unique domains such as:
  - Arts & Cultural Heritage (Yale's museums and collections)
  - Medical & Clinical Operations (Yale School of Medicine)
  - Yale College Experience (undergraduate education)
  - Athletics & Student Activities

### Data Migration Approach

To handle existing data in the system:

1. Existing generic impact assessments will be mapped to Yale departments
2. Analysis content will be preserved while removing non-Yale sections
3. Yale-specific departments will be automatically assigned based on impact area mappings

## Benefits of Yale-Specific Focus

The Yale-specific focus provides several advantages:

1. **Direct Relevance**: Every impact assessment is specifically relevant to Yale
2. **Clearer Responsibilities**: Each impact is directly mapped to Yale departments
3. **Simpler Data Model**: Focused exclusively on Yale's organizational structure
4. **Reduced Complexity**: Simpler code and data structures for easier maintenance
5. **More Efficient Operation**: Smaller export files without unnecessary fields

## Next Steps

Following the implementation of Phase 1:

1. Create Yale-specific dashboard views
2. Add Yale's mission alignment assessment to analysis
3. Implement Yale-specific search and filtering
4. Create department-specific views and notifications
5. Develop email notification capabilities for specific Yale departments

## Technical Considerations

When maintaining the system:

1. New impact areas should be mapped to specific Yale departments
2. Department structure changes should be reflected in the database
3. AI prompts should focus exclusively on Yale's organizational context
4. Export formats should maintain the streamlined Yale-specific structure
