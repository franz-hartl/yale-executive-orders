It imposes strict accounting provisions and anti-bribery penalties. Higher education has faced increased FCPA scrutiny in recent years, with several institutions paying multi-million dollar settlements.</p>\n            </div>\n            \n            <div style=\"margin-bottom: 1rem;\">\n              <h4 style=\"font-size: 1rem; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;\">Legal Framework:</h4>\n              <p style=\"margin-bottom: 1rem;\">The FCPA is enforced jointly by the DOJ and SEC. This order likely directs them to deprioritize investigations and penalties, but does not change the underlying statute. Bribery may still violate other federal and state laws. University counsel will need to navigate this uncertain legal landscape.</p>\n            </div>\n            \n            <div style=\"margin-bottom: 1rem;\">\n              <h4 style=\"font-size: 1rem; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;\">Higher Education Context:</h4>\n              <p style=\"margin-bottom: 1rem;\">With intense competition for international students, research talent and global prestige, this order adds to already strong pressures and incentives for universities to expand their overseas footprint and partnerships.

By relaxing anti-corruption restrictions, the order seeks to advance American economic and national security interests abroad. However, it creates complex financial, legal and ethical implications for higher education institutions.</p>\n            <p style=\"font-size: 1rem; background-color: #f0f9ff; padding: 0.75rem; border-left: 4px solid #2563eb; font-weight: 500;\">\n              <strong>Bottom Line:</strong> While this order may unlock new international funding streams, universities must carefully navigate the increased risks around financial misconduct, legal liability, and reputational damage.

It imposes strict accounting provisions and anti-bribery penalties. Higher education has faced increased FCPA scrutiny in recent years, with several institutions paying multi-million dollar settlements.</p>\n            </div>\n            \n            <div style=\"margin-bottom: 1rem;\">\n              <h4 style=\"font-size: 1rem; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;\">Legal Framework:</h4>\n              <p style=\"margin-bottom: 1rem;\">The FCPA is enforced jointly by the DOJ and SEC. This order likely directs them to deprioritize investigations and penalties, but does not change the underlying statute. Bribery may still violate other federal and state laws. University counsel will need to navigate this uncertain legal landscape.</p>\n            </div>\n            \n            <div style=\"margin-bottom: 1rem;\">\n              <h4 style=\"font-size: 1rem; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;\">Higher Education Context:</h4>\n              <p style=\"margin-bottom: 1rem;\">With intense competition for international students, research talent and global prestige, this order adds to already strong pressures and incentives for universities to expand their overseas footprint and partnerships.
