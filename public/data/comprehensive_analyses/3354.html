Executive Order 14058, 'Transforming Federal Customer Experience and Service Delivery To Rebuild Trust in Government,' directs federal agencies to improve their customer experience and service delivery. This will have several implications for research universities like Yale.  

The order mandates increased data sharing and coordination between agencies and their external partners, including higher education institutions. This will require updates to compliance procedures and reporting across multiple administrative offices at Yale, most notably the Office of Research Administration, Financial Aid, and Bursar.

The Office of Research Administration will need to enhance its data collection and submission processes to provide more detailed grant information to federal agencies. This could include reporting on grant activities, expenditures, and outcomes in a more standardized format. The Financial Aid office will likely face new requirements for submitting student data, such as enrollment status, academic progress, and financial aid package details. The Bursar's office may need to share more granular payment and account information.

While the order does not directly impact funding levels, the new compliance burden could indirectly increase administrative costs for the university. Institutions will need to dedicate staff time and resources to updating data systems, training personnel, and coordinating with agencies. There may also be direct charges associated with providing additional data and reports.

Research universities should prioritize the following actions in the next 6-12 months:
1) Review current data sharing practices and identify gaps or inefficiencies
2) Engage with relevant federal agencies to understand new reporting requirements 
3) Develop an implementation plan to modify administrative processes and technologies
4) Allocate resources for compliance efforts and track associated costs
5) Communicate changes to faculty, staff, and students to ensure smooth implementation
