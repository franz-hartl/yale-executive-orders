Executive Order 14114, titled 'Ensuring Lawful Governance and Implementing the President's 'Department of Government Efficiency' Deregulatory Initiative,' seeks to reduce regulatory burdens on federal agencies and improve government operations. While the order's primary focus is on government efficiency, it could have wide-ranging effects on higher education institutions, particularly public universities and research-intensive institutions.

The order directs federal agencies to review existing regulations and identify opportunities for streamlining or eliminating requirements. This could impact higher education in areas such as administrative compliance, research funding, and public-private partnerships. Smaller, private liberal arts colleges may face fewer direct challenges, as they often have more autonomy from federal regulations.

However, the order also emphasizes the need for consistent application of regulations across agencies, which could introduce new compliance requirements for institutions. Additionally, the order's focus on 'lawful governance' raises concerns about potential changes to policies related to academic freedom, diversity, and other core higher education values.
