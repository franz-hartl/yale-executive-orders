# Yale-Centric Refinement Implementation

This document outlines the implementation of Phase 3: Yale-Specific Context Enhancement, which builds on the previous Private R1 focus to create a specialized version of the Executive Orders Analysis tool tailored to Yale University's unique institutional profile.

## Yale's Comprehensive Identity

Yale University has a unique institutional profile that extends beyond its role as a research university:

- **Academic Breadth**: Beyond research, Yale has exceptional undergraduate education, professional schools, and liberal arts focus
- **Cultural Institutions**: Yale's museums and arts programs are central to its identity and mission
- **Global Perspective**: International student body and global programs form a core part of Yale's character
- **Medical Enterprise**: Yale School of Medicine and Yale New Haven Hospital represent a major component
- **Historic Legacy**: As one of America's oldest institutions, Yale has distinct traditions and governance structures

## Implementation Approach

The Yale-specific implementation follows these key design principles:

1. **Add Rather Than Replace**: We're keeping the research-intensive parameters from Phases 1 and 2 while adding Yale-specific layers as additional context.

2. **Yale Stakeholder Profiles**: We've developed preset views for different Yale stakeholders (Provost's Office, Museum Directors, Athletics, etc.) with each profile emphasizing relevant impact areas and compliance requirements.

3. **Yale-Specific AI Prompt Enhancements**: Building on Phase 2 changes, we've added Yale-specific context to AI prompts that consider Yale's governance structure, key programs, and specific compliance requirements.

## Technical Implementation Details

### Database Schema Extensions

We've extended the database schema with new Yale-specific tables:

- `yale_impact_areas`: Specialized impact areas relevant to Yale's unique operations
- `order_yale_impact_areas`: Junction table connecting executive orders to Yale impact areas
- `yale_stakeholders`: Key Yale administrative units and offices
- `order_yale_stakeholders`: Junction table with stakeholder priority and action requirements

### Yale-Specific Data Files

New data files have been created to support Yale-specific features:

- `yale_impact_areas.json`: 12 specialized impact areas including original R1 areas plus Yale-specific domains (Arts & Cultural Heritage, Medical & Clinical Operations, Yale College Experience, etc.)
- `yale_stakeholders.json`: 12 key Yale administrative units with relevant impact area mappings

### AI Analysis Enhancements

The AI prompt system has been enhanced to:

1. Provide Yale-specific context in all analyses
2. Identify specific Yale stakeholders for each executive order
3. Include Yale-unique considerations like impacts on:
   - Arts and cultural collections
   - Medical and clinical operations
   - Undergraduate residential experience
   - Athletics and student life

### User Interface Considerations

The planned UI enhancements will include:

1. Yale-specific filtering options
2. Stakeholder-based views
3. Impact visualization by Yale unit
4. Yale-centric terminology throughout

## Key Files Modified

- `/database_setup.js`: Added Yale-specific tables and initialization
- `/export_to_json.js`: Added Yale-specific data export functionality
- `/generate_plain_summaries.js`: Enhanced AI prompts with Yale context
- `/yale_specific_data/yale_impact_areas.json`: New Yale impact areas
- `/yale_specific_data/yale_stakeholders.json`: Yale stakeholder mapping

## Next Steps

1. Create Yale stakeholder-specific dashboard views
2. Implement Yale-specific visualization components
3. Add Yale's mission alignment assessment to analysis
4. Develop Yale-specific search and filtering options

This implementation maintains compatibility with the general R1 university focus while providing a layer of Yale-specific context that makes the tool more relevant and useful for Yale administrators.
