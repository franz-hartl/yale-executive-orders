# Yale-Specific Executive Order Analysis Approach

This document outlines the implementation of a Yale-specific taxonomy and AI prompt enhancements for the Executive Orders Analysis Platform, building on the previous Private R1 focus to create an analysis system tailored to Yale University's unique institutional structure.

## Yale's Comprehensive Identity

Yale University has a unique institutional profile that extends beyond its role as a research university:

- **Academic Breadth**: Yale has exceptional undergraduate education, professional schools, and liberal arts focus
- **Cultural Institutions**: Yale's museums and arts programs are central to its identity and mission
- **Global Perspective**: International student body and global programs form a core part of Yale's character
- **Medical Enterprise**: Yale School of Medicine and Yale New Haven Hospital represent a major component
- **Historic Legacy**: Yale has distinct traditions and governance structures

## Yale-Specific Taxonomy

The platform now uses a specialized taxonomy designed to align with Yale University's organizational structure and priorities:

### Core Impact Categories

1. **Research & Innovation**
   - Federal grants, funding priorities, research initiatives
   - Maps to: Vice Provost for Research, Office of Sponsored Projects, ORA

2. **Research Security & Export Control**
   - Security requirements, export controls, foreign research collaborations
   - Maps to: RISO, Export Controls, Office of Research Compliance

3. **International & Immigration**
   - International students, scholar mobility, visa regulations
   - Maps to: OISS, Federal/State Relations, Global Strategy

4. **Community & Belonging**
   - Community building, belonging initiatives, educational equity
   - Maps to: Office of Institutional Equity, Title IX Coordinator, Cultural Centers

5. **Campus Safety & Student Affairs**
   - Campus safety, student life, residential colleges
   - Maps to: Yale College Dean, Student Life, Public Safety, Health Services

6. **Faculty & Workforce**
   - Faculty administration, employment policies, workforce management
   - Maps to: HR, Provost (Faculty Admin), General Counsel (Employment)

7. **Healthcare & Public Health**
   - Yale School of Medicine, Yale Health, public health initiatives
   - Maps to: School of Medicine Dean, Yale Health, Public Health Dean

8. **Financial & Operations**
   - Financial operations, endowment management, facilities, IT
   - Maps to: Finance (Controller, Budget Office), Facilities, CIO/IT

9. **Governance & Legal**
   - Governance structure, legal compliance, university policies
   - Maps to: President, General Counsel, Secretary

### Category Cross-Listing

Executive orders can be tagged with multiple categories, with primary, secondary, and tertiary designations:

- Example 1: An EO on "Protecting U.S. University Research from Foreign Interference" would be tagged:
  - Primary: Research Security & Export Control
  - Secondary: Research & Innovation
  - Tertiary: International & Immigration

- Example 2: An EO on pandemic response at universities might be tagged:
  - Primary: Campus Safety & Student Affairs
  - Secondary: Healthcare & Public Health

## AI Prompt Enhancement for Yale Context

### Providing Yale Institutional Context

When analyzing executive orders, the AI is prompted with Yale-specific context:

```
Context: Yale University relies on $1.3B in annual research expenditures and has a robust 
compliance framework led by an Institutional Compliance Program. Yale also values global 
engagement and diversity.

Task: Analyze Executive Order XYZ for its impact on Yale. Discuss which Yale offices would 
be involved, how ongoing research might be affected, and what compliance steps Yale should consider.
```

### Using the Taxonomy in Analysis

The AI structures its analysis according to the taxonomy categories:

```
Analyze Executive Order 14xxx according to Yale's impact taxonomy. For each relevant 
category (Research & Innovation, International & Immigration, etc.), address:
1. Impact on that aspect of Yale (with examples)
2. What Yale must do to comply or respond
3. Any risks or opportunities the EO presents to Yale in that domain
```

### Generating Actionable Outputs

The AI is instructed to provide specific, actionable recommendations:

```
Given the analysis of the EO's impact, list five specific actions Yale University should take 
to ensure compliance and minimize disruption. Consider actions by relevant Yale offices, 
communications to affected community members, policy updates needed, and coordination with peer institutions.
```

## Technical Implementation Details

### Database Schema Extensions

We've extended the database schema with Yale-specific tables:

- `yale_impact_areas`: Specialized impact areas relevant to Yale's unique operations
- `yale_stakeholders`: Key Yale administrative units and offices

### Yale-Specific Data Files

New data files support Yale-specific features:

- `yale_impact_areas.json`: Specialized impact areas aligned with the new taxonomy
- `yale_stakeholders.json`: Yale stakeholder mapping to impact areas

### AI Analysis Enhancements

The AI prompt system now:

1. Provides Yale-specific context in all analyses
2. Identifies specific Yale stakeholders for each executive order
3. Structures analysis according to the Yale-specific taxonomy
4. Generates actionable recommendations for Yale offices

## Next Steps

1. Create Yale stakeholder-specific dashboard views
2. Implement enhanced search that incorporates the taxonomy
3. Develop visualization components that show impact by Yale category
4. Create a routing system to notify relevant Yale stakeholders

This implementation maintains compatibility with the general R1 university focus while providing a Yale-specific taxonomy and analysis structure that makes the tool more relevant and actionable for Yale administrators.
