            <h2 style="color: #2563eb; font-size: 1.5rem; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Executive Order 13902: Expansion of Iran Sanctions Likely Has Limited Higher Education Impact</h2>
            <p style="font-size: 1rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>Overview:</strong> On January 10, 2020, President Trump signed Executive Order 13902, imposing new sanctions on the construction, mining, manufacturing, and textiles sectors of Iran's economy. This action builds upon the administration's 'maximum pressure' campaign aimed at compelling changes in Iran's behavior by applying economic pressure.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 1rem; background-color: #f0f9ff; padding: 0.75rem; border-left: 4px solid #2563eb; font-weight: 500;">
              <strong>Bottom Line:</strong> The new sanctions on additional sectors of Iran's economy do not appear to significantly impact the operations of most U.S. colleges and universities. However, institutions with investments, partnerships, or programs relating to the newly sanctioned sectors should carefully evaluate their exposure.

            <div style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">
              <h4 style="font-size: 1rem; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Policy Background:</h4>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">The U.S. has imposed increasingly stringent sanctions on Iran since the Trump administration withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal in 2018. These sanctions aim to pressure Iran by limiting its economic activity and reducing its oil exports. Higher education has not been a primary focus of recent sanctions.</p>

            <div style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">
              <h4 style="font-size: 1rem; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Legal Framework:</h4>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">The President issued the sanctions under the authority of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), the National Emergencies Act (NEA), and other statutes. The Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) administers and enforces the sanctions.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">
              <h4 style="font-size: 1rem; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Higher Education Context:</h4>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">U.S. colleges and universities must ensure compliance with Iran sanctions, like other regulated sectors. Schools with investments, partnerships, or other ties to the newly sanctioned sectors face the most significant potential impact.</p>

            <h3 style="color: #2563eb; font-size: 1.25rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem;">Key Impacts on Higher Education:</h3>
            <div style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">
              
                <div style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem; padding: 0.75rem; background-color: #f9fafb; border-radius: 0.375rem;">
                  <p><strong>Investments:</strong> University endowments and employee retirement plans must ensure any holdings related to the sanctioned sectors of Iran's economy are compliant with the updated sanctions. However, given existing sanctions, most institutions likely have little to no direct exposure.</p>
                </div>
              
                <div style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem; padding: 0.75rem; background-color: #f9fafb; border-radius: 0.375rem;">
                  <p><strong>Research Partnerships:</strong> Universities should re-evaluate any research partnerships with Iranian entities to determine if they intersect with newly sanctioned sectors. If so, those ties may need to be terminated or restructured to ensure compliance.</p>
                </div>
              
                <div style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem; padding: 0.75rem; background-color: #f9fafb; border-radius: 0.375rem;">
                  <p><strong>Educational Exchanges:</strong> Academic exchanges and study abroad programs focused on Iran should be reviewed to avoid activities related to sanctioned sectors. In most cases, the new sanctions are unlikely to significantly affect overall educational exchanges with Iran, which are already limited.</p>
                </div>
              
                <div style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem; padding: 0.75rem; background-color: #f9fafb; border-radius: 0.375rem;">
                  <p><strong>International Students:</strong> The new sanctions do not directly affect Iranian students in the U.S. However, some students may face increased scrutiny around ties to sanctioned sectors. Universities can support affected students while ensuring their own compliance.</p>
                </div>
              
                <div style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem; padding: 0.75rem; background-color: #f9fafb; border-radius: 0.375rem;">
                  <p><strong>Regulatory Compliance:</strong> Higher education institutions must navigate a complex array of U.S. sanctions and export control regulations. The new sanctions add to this complexity but do not fundamentally change most universities' existing compliance obligations and processes.</p>

            <div style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">
              <h4 style="font-size: 1rem; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Compliance Requirements:</h4>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">The Executive Order prohibits U.S. persons from engaging in transactions with the sanctioned sectors of Iran's economy. Universities should consult with legal counsel to determine how their activities may be affected based on a risk-based compliance assessment.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">
              <h4 style="font-size: 1rem; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Technical Analysis:</h4>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">The sanctions target Iran's construction, mining, manufacturing, and textiles sectors, which are already significantly affected by existing U.S. sanctions. The new sanctions also authorize secondary sanctions on foreign financial institutions that conduct certain transactions with the targeted sectors.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">
              <h4 style="font-size: 1rem; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Cross-Functional Impacts:</h4>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">While the sanctions primarily implicate financial and international affairs units, they also affect research administration, study abroad, and student services. Effective compliance requires coordination across these areas.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">
              <h4 style="font-size: 1rem; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Risk Analysis:</h4>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">The primary compliance risks relate to investments, financial transactions, and partnerships that may involve the sanctioned sectors. Violations could result in significant penalties. However, most institutions' exposure is likely low if they were already complying with previous sanctions.</p>

            <div style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">
              <h4 style="font-size: 1rem; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Competitive Implications:</h4>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">Institutions with more extensive global partnerships, particularly those with ties to Iran, may face greater compliance burdens and potential competitive impacts compared to schools with more limited international engagement.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">
              <h4 style="font-size: 1rem; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Long-term Vision:</h4>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">The new sanctions are part of an evolving landscape of U.S. economic restrictions affecting higher education. Schools must be agile in adapting to these changes while still advancing their educational missions and global engagement strategies.</p>

              <h4 style="font-size: 1rem; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Advocacy Opportunities:</h4>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">Higher education associations may engage with policymakers to ensure sanctions do not unduly restrict educational activities. Schools can provide input on the impacts of sanctions policies to inform future implementation.</p>
