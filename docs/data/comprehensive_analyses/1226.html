            <h2 style="color: #2563eb; font-size: 1.5rem; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Presidential Commission on Improving American Health Established by Executive Order</h2>
            <p style="font-size: 1rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>Overview:</strong> The President has issued an executive order to establish a new commission focused on developing a comprehensive set of recommendations to improve various aspects of the health and well-being of Americans. Major areas of focus will include addressing the obesity epidemic, enhancing mental health services, and expanding access to quality healthcare, especially for underserved populations.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 1rem; background-color: #f0f9ff; padding: 0.75rem; border-left: 4px solid #2563eb; font-weight: 500;">
              <strong>Bottom Line:</strong> While this order does not mandate any immediate changes to university operations, higher education institutions should closely monitor the commission's activities, as the resulting recommendations could lead to significant shifts in federal research funding priorities and may spur new regulations that require universities to take compliance action.
