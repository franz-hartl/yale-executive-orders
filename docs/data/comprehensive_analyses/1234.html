            <h2 style="color: #2563eb; font-size: 1.5rem; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Executive Order 2025-02478 on Northern Border Situation Requires Thorough University Compliance Review</h2>
            <p style="font-size: 1rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>Overview:</strong> On February 10, 2025, the President signed Executive Order 2025-02478, titled "Progress on the Situation at Our Northern Border". The order appears targeted at addressing issues related to border security and immigration along the U.S.-Canada border. While the full implications for higher education institutions are not yet clear, the order may introduce new administrative compliance obligations.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 1rem; background-color: #f0f9ff; padding: 0.75rem; border-left: 4px solid #2563eb; font-weight: 500;">
              <strong>Bottom Line:</strong> Universities should thoroughly analyze the text of this executive order and engage in proactive compliance planning and impact assessment.

              <h4 style="font-size: 1rem; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Policy Background:</h4>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">This order continues a series of presidential actions in recent years focused on border security and assessment of visa policies. While the northern border has generally received less attention than the southern border, there have been increasing concerns about drug trafficking and terrorism threats.</p>

              <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">The order will likely rely on presidential authority over foreign affairs and national security. Resulting rules will need to fit within existing statutory frameworks related to immigration and higher education.</p>
            </div>

            <div style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">
              <h4 style="font-size: 1rem; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Compliance Requirements:</h4>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">Until federal agencies release specific implementation guidance for this order, the full scope of required compliance actions is unknown. However, universities should anticipate the potential need to collect additional data on foreign students and scholars, make changes to admissions and visa application processes, and submit additional reports to the government.</p>

              <h4 style="font-size: 1rem; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Technical Analysis:</h4>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">Complying with new rules may require updates to student information systems, human resources platforms, and reporting tools. It may require development of new data integrations between systems. Universities will need to assess their current technology capabilities against new requirements.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">

              <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">While an international student office may lead compliance efforts, this order could have wide-ranging impacts across a university. It could affect admissions, academic affairs, student services, human resources, financial aid, legal affairs, and more. Universities will need cross-functional teams to assess and address impacts.</p>

              <h4 style="font-size: 1rem; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Competitive Implications:</h4>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">New compliance burdens could disadvantage smaller institutions with less administrative capacity. Changes to visa rules could make Canadian student recruitment more difficult and expensive. Some universities may need to reconsider Canadian recruitment strategies.</p>
