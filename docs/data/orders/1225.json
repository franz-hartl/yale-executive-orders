  "summary": "This executive order establishes the National Energy Dominance Council, a new federal entity tasked with developing and implementing a strategy to maximize the United States' energy production and export capabilities. The order directs federal agencies to prioritize policies and regulations that support the expansion of fossil fuel extraction and exports.",
  "full_text": "Universities like Yale may face increased energy costs and challenges securing funding for sustainability initiatives and research related to renewable energy, as the order could shift federal priorities and resources away from clean energy development. This could strain university budgets and limit their ability to invest in campus greening efforts.",
