Its goal is to generate long-term investment returns to support U.S. fiscal and economic priorities. The reallocation of federal resources to capitalize this fund may result in decreased Congressional allocations for higher education, including cuts to research grant programs, student aid, and other federal support. Universities must assess their federal funding dependency and develop strategic plans to mitigate potential budget shortfalls.</p>\n            <p style=\"font-size: 1rem; background-color: #f0f9ff; padding: 0.75rem; border-left: 4px solid #2563eb; font-weight: 500;\">\n              <strong>Bottom Line:</strong> The establishment of the U.S. Sovereign Wealth Fund poses a significant threat to higher education federal funding.
