President Trump's executive order reinstating service members discharged under the military's COVID-19 vaccination mandate has limited direct impact on Yale University's core operations. However, several peripheral university functions that intersect with military service and veteran affairs will experience modest effects.

Yale's veteran student services may need to prepare for potential enrollment increases as reinstated service members pursue educational opportunities. The Office of Veteran Affairs should monitor whether any previously discharged service members who may now return to active duty were enrolled at Yale, potentially requiring adjustments to their academic planning and benefits processing.

The university's Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) programs will need to align with updated military vaccination policies, which could affect ROTC scholarship terms, training requirements, and administrative protocols. Yale Health and other clinical services should review their vaccination and exemption protocols to ensure alignment with evolving federal approaches, particularly for programs receiving federal funding or serving military-affiliated populations.
