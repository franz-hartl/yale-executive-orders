## Integration Steps

To fully integrate the Yale Component Library into the Executive Orders project, follow these steps:

### Phase 1: Style Integration

1. **Replace the core CSS file**
   ```bash
   mv /Users/franzhartl/yale-executive-orders/docs/css/styles.css.new /Users/franzhartl/yale-executive-orders/docs/css/styles.css
   ```

2. **Update the HTML files to include the component library CSS**
   - Edit `/docs/index.html` to include the new CSS files if needed

### Phase 2: JavaScript Integration

1. **Replace the core JavaScript file**
   ```bash
   mv /Users/franzhartl/yale-executive-orders/docs/js/app.js.new /Users/franzhartl/yale-executive-orders/docs/js/app.js
   ```

2. **Update the HTML files to include the component library JavaScript**
   - Edit `/docs/index.html` to include the new JavaScript files

### Phase 3: HTML Updates

1. **Update the main index.html file to use the new component classes**
   - Replace `.btn-primary` with `.yale-btn.yale-btn--primary`, etc.
   - Replace `.card` with `.yale-card`, etc.
   - Add proper ARIA attributes for improved accessibility

2. **Update other HTML files as needed**
   - Any other pages that use the same components

### Phase 4: Testing

1. **Test all functionality**
   - Verify that all components work correctly
   - Verify that all interactions (sorting, filtering, modal dialogs) work correctly
   - Verify that accessibility features work correctly

2. **Test across different screen sizes**
   - Verify that responsive design works correctly
   - Verify that mobile interactions work correctly

3. **Test with keyboard navigation and screen readers**
   - Verify that keyboard navigation works correctly
   - Verify that screen readers can access all content

### Phase 5: Documentation Update

1. **Update existing documentation**
   - Add references to the new component library
   - Update any code examples to use the new component classes

2. **Add the component library documentation**
   - Include the new documentation files in the project

## Expected Impact

The integration of the Yale Component Library will have the following impact on the Executive Orders project:

1. **Improved Design Consistency**
   - Consistent colors, typography, and spacing
   - Consistent component design
   - Better alignment with Yale branding

2. **Enhanced Accessibility**
   - Improved keyboard navigation
   - Better screen reader support
   - Reduced motion support
   - High contrast mode support

3. **Better Maintainability**
   - Clear component structure
   - Documented usage patterns
   - Separation of concerns

4. **Improved User Experience**
   - More interactive and responsive components
   - Better feedback for user actions
   - Clearer information hierarchy

## Risk Mitigation

To minimize risks during the integration process:

1. **Backward Compatibility**
   - The new styles extend the existing classes to maintain backward compatibility
   - Legacy class names will continue to work

2. **Incremental Integration**
   - Start with global styles and layout components
   - Then update buttons and form elements
   - Then update cards and data display components
   - Then update modal and tab components
   - Finally, update notification components

3. **Testing at Each Step**
   - Test each component after integration
   - Test interactions between components
   - Test edge cases

## Timeline

The integration can be completed in the following timeline:

1. **Phase 1: Style Integration** - 1 day
2. **Phase 2: JavaScript Integration** - 1 day
3. **Phase 3: HTML Updates** - 2-3 days
4. **Phase 4: Testing** - 1-2 days
5. **Phase 5: Documentation Update** - 1 day

Total estimated time: 6-8 days

## Conclusion

The Yale Component Library provides a robust foundation for the Executive Orders project's user interface. By following this integration plan, the project will benefit from improved design consistency, enhanced accessibility, better maintainability, and an improved user experience.
