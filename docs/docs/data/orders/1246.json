While the order does not directly address universities, they will need to take proactive steps to align institutional naming practices with this new mandate. This will require careful consideration of campus naming conventions, stakeholder engagement, legal and financial implications, and alignment with mission and values.</p>\n            <p style=\"font-size: 1rem; background-color: #f0f9ff; padding: 0.75rem; border-left: 4px solid #2563eb; font-weight: 500;\">\n              <strong>Bottom Line:</strong> Universities should use this order as an opportunity to thoughtfully re-examine naming practices, engage their communities in productive dialogue, and take bold action where renaming serves the institutional mission.
