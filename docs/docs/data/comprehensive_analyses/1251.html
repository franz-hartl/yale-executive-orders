            <h2 style="color: #2563eb; font-size: 1.5rem; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Unleashing American Energy: Promoting Domestic Production and Potential University Impacts</h2>
            <p style="font-size: 1rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>Overview:</strong> The 'Unleashing American Energy' executive order seeks to bolster domestic energy production from all sources, particularly fossil fuels, in order to enhance U.S. energy independence, stimulate economic growth, and reduce regulatory burdens on the energy industry. The order instructs federal agencies to review existing regulations and policies that may obstruct or slow the development of domestic energy resources.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 1rem; background-color: #f0f9ff; padding: 0.75rem; border-left: 4px solid #2563eb; font-weight: 500;">
              <strong>Bottom Line:</strong> While universities' diversified research funding and endowment investments may limit the overall financial impact, institutions should carefully review their energy-related research portfolios, investment strategies, and campus sustainability plans to identify and mitigate potential risks and adapt to the changing policy landscape.
