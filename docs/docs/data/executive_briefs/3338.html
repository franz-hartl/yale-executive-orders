President Trump's executive order withdrawing the United States from the World Health Organization (WHO) will have substantial implications for Yale University's global health research enterprise, international collaborations, and educational programs. Yale School of Public Health and Yale School of Medicine maintain extensive research partnerships, data-sharing arrangements, and collaborative initiatives with WHO and institutions in its global network.

Yale's global health research portfolio, which includes approximately $70-90 million in active grants addressing international health challenges, faces potential disruptions to data access, collaborative frameworks, and certain funding streams. Projects directly involving WHO as a partner or utilizing WHO surveillance data will require strategic recalibration. Faculty leading these initiatives should identify alternative partnership structures and data sources where possible, while preparing for potential complications in multinational research protocols.

Educational programs will also face adjustment requirements, particularly Yale School of Public Health's Global Health Concentration, which sends students to WHO-affiliated sites for internships and research projects. Academic programs should develop alternative placement opportunities while ensuring students maintain access to global health learning experiences despite changing institutional partnerships.

Financially, Yale should prepare for potential funding challenges for global health initiatives previously supported through WHO-adjacent mechanisms, while identifying alternative support channels for critical international health research. Strategic planning should focus on maintaining Yale's global health leadership position while navigating a significantly altered international health governance landscape.
