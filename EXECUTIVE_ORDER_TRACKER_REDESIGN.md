# Yale Executive Order Tracker Redesign Proposal

## Strategic Shift from AI Summaries to External Resources & Categorization

### Background
The current Yale Executive Order Tracker has been primarily focused on AI-generated summaries of executive orders. While these summaries provide valuable insights, they lack the critical context and analysis provided by domain experts, government agencies, and higher education organizations.

### New Approach
We propose shifting the focus from AI-generated summaries to a more comprehensive categorization system with direct links to external resources, commentary, and analysis. This approach will:

1. **Leverage external expertise**: Connect users to authoritative commentary from organizations like COGR, ACE, and domain-specific publications
2. **Improve practical utility**: Help Yale departments quickly find the most relevant analysis for their specific areas
3. **Reduce dependency on AI summarization**: Focus on extracting structured data and relationships rather than generating text

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Enhanced Data Structure
We've already begun implementing this approach with two new data fields:

```json
"external_resources": {
  "Administrative Compliance": [
    {
      "name": "COGR Analysis",
      "url": "https://cogr.edu/...",
      "description": "COGR's analysis of compliance implications..."
    }
  ]
},
"related_commentary": {
  "Administrative Compliance": [
    {
      "source": "Higher Ed Dive",
      "title": "What Trump's New Executive Order Means for Colleges",
      "url": "https://www.highereddive.com/...",
      "publication_date": "2025-03-01"
    }
  ]
}
```

Each executive order will now include:
- External resources organized by impact area (from authoritative organizations)
- Related commentary from media, academia, and analysis sites
- Clear categorization across multiple dimensions

### 2. UI Enhancements
The UI has been updated to:
- Add a "Resources" column to the main table
- Include filtering by resource availability
- Display external resources and commentary directly in the detail view
- Create more prominent categorization displays

### 3. Data Collection Strategy
To populate this enhanced structure, we will:

1. **Establish relationships with key organizations**:
   - Council on Governmental Relations (COGR)
   - American Council on Education (ACE)
   - National Science Foundation (NSF)
   - National Institutes of Health (NIH)

2. **Create a systematic monitoring process** for:
   - Official agency implementation guidance
   - Higher education association analysis
   - Academic and legal commentary
   - Yale-specific impact analysis

3. **Add structured data extraction** for:
   - Compliance deadlines and requirements
   - Department-specific impacts
   - Cross-references to related orders

### 4. New Focus Areas

#### Category Expansion
Expand the current categories to include more granular classification:
- Current: Technology, Education, Finance, etc.
- New additions: Administrative Procedures, Grant Management, Foreign Influence

#### External Resource Types
Classify external resources by type:
- Official Agency Guidance
- Association Analysis
- Legal Commentary
- Implementation Toolkits
- Webinars & Training Resources

#### Timeline Integration
Add structured timeline data to track:
- Comment periods
- Implementation deadlines
- Agency decision dates

## Benefits of New Approach

1. **More authoritative information**: Direct links to recognized experts rather than AI interpretation
2. **Richer context**: Multiple perspectives on each order's impact
3. **Faster updates**: New resources can be linked immediately as they become available
4. **Better decision support**: Yale departments can quickly find the most relevant analysis
5. **Reduced duplication**: Leverage existing high-quality analysis rather than creating redundant summaries

## Technical Requirements

1. **Data schema updates**: Already implemented in the JSON structure
2. **UI modifications**: Already implemented in the interface
3. **Resource monitoring system**: Need to establish automated monitoring of key sources
4. **Quality control process**: Need guidelines for resource selection and vetting

## Next Steps

1. Begin systematic collection of external resources for existing executive orders
2. Establish relationships with key organizations for direct notification of new analysis
3. Pilot the new approach with 5-10 high-impact executive orders
4. Gather feedback from Yale stakeholders on the utility of the new focus
5. Develop automated tools to assist in external resource discovery and categorization
